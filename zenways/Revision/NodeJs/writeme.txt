It is unclear when the convention began, but there are examples dating back to the mid 1970s.[4][5][better source needed]

In particular, there is a long history of free software and open-source software including a README file; in fact it is a requirement in the GNU Coding Standards.[6][better source needed]

Since the advent of the web as a de facto standard platform for software distribution, many software packages have moved (or occasionally, copied) some of the above ancillary files and pieces of information to a website or wiki, sometimes including the README itself, or sometimes leaving behind only a brief README file without all of the information required by a new user of the software.

In more recent times, the popular GitHub proprietary Git repository[7] strongly encourages a README file - if one is included in the main (top-level) directory, it is automatically presented on the main web page. While traditional plain text is supported, various different file extensions and formats are also supported,[8] and conversion to HTML takes account of the file extension of the file â€“ in particular a "README.md" file would be treated as a GitHub Flavored Markdown file.
